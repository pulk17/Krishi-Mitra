# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A simple plant diagnosis app that helps farmers identify plant diseases using AI. The app allows users to upload plant images and receive structured diagnosis with treatment recommendations. This is designed to be the simplest possible implementation while still being useful.

3. WHEN the AI cannot identify a disease THEN the system SHALL return "Healthy Plant" or "Unable to diagnose"
4. IF the AI call fails THEN the system SHALL show a simple error message with retry option

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to see the diagnosis results in a clear format, so that I can understand what to do next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN diagnosis results are returned THEN the system SHALL display them in a clean, readable format
