# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the overall user experience and code quality of the application by addressing several key areas: environment configuration management, loading state optimization, file selection capabilities, settings organization, authentication improvements, and codebase cleanup. The goal is to create a more streamlined, user-friendly application with cleaner architecture and better performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Environment Configuration Simplification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single source of truth for environment variables, so that configuration management is simplified and there's no duplication or sync issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL use only the root .env file as the single source of truth
2. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN the system SHALL NOT require any sync mechanisms between different env files
3. WHEN deploying or configuring THEN developers SHALL only need to manage one environment file

### Requirement 2: Loading State Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want loading spinners to appear only when necessary, so that the interface feels more responsive and less jarring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a quick operation occurs THEN the system SHALL NOT show loading spinners for operations under 200ms
2. WHEN multiple rapid requests happen THEN the system SHALL debounce loading states to prevent flickering
3. WHEN loading states are shown THEN they SHALL be contextual and informative

### Requirement 3: Multiple File Selection

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select multiple files at once, so that I can process several files efficiently in a single operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting files THEN the system SHALL allow multiple file selection using standard UI patterns
2. WHEN multiple files are selected THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the count and names of selected files
3. WHEN processing multiple files THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently and provide progress feedback

### Requirement 4: Settings Organization

**User Story:** As a user, I want language selection to be in the settings menu, so that all configuration options are centrally located and easily accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing settings THEN the system SHALL include language selection options
2. WHEN changing language THEN the system SHALL persist the preference and apply it immediately
3. WHEN the settings dialog opens THEN all user preferences SHALL be organized in logical groups

### Requirement 5: Google Account Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want my Google account name to be displayed when signed in, so that I have a personalized experience and clear indication of my authentication status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN signed in with Google THEN the system SHALL display the user's name from their Google account
2. WHEN the user's name is displayed THEN it SHALL be retrieved from the authenticated Google profile
3. WHEN authentication status changes THEN the display SHALL update accordingly

### Requirement 6: Guest Mode Access

**User Story:** As a user, I want the option to continue without signing in, so that I can use the application immediately without creating an account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL provide a "Continue without signing in" option
2. WHEN using guest mode THEN the system SHALL use local storage for data persistence
3. WHEN in guest mode THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the temporary nature of the session

### Requirement 7: Local Storage Data Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be stored locally when not signed in, so that I can use the application offline and maintain my work between sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN not authenticated THEN the system SHALL store user data in browser local storage
2. WHEN switching between authenticated and guest modes THEN data SHALL be handled appropriately
3. WHEN using local storage THEN the system SHALL handle storage limits and cleanup gracefully

### Requirement 8: Codebase Quality and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, well-organized code with proper error handling, so that the application is maintainable, reliable, and easy to extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing code THEN all components SHALL follow consistent patterns and best practices
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with appropriate user feedback
3. WHEN maintaining code THEN the structure SHALL be logical, well-documented, and easy to navigate
4. WHEN the application runs THEN there SHALL be no console errors or warnings in normal operation
